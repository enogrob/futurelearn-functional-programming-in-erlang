WEEK 1: GETTING STARTED WITH ERLANG
An introduction to Erlang
Welcome to the course! In this first activity you'll get an opportunity to introduce yourself, and we'll look at the background to functional programming and Erlang. You'll also download and install Erlang to your own machine.
[x] 1.1 WELCOME VIDEO (01:07)
[x] 1.2 WHY ERLANG? VIDEO (06:44)
[x] 1.3 ERLANG AND FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING VIDEO (03:39)
[x] 1.4 ERLANG IN THE FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING LANDSCAPE VIDEO (05:43)
[x] 1.5 USING THE ERLANG SYSTEM VIDEO (05:47)
[x] 1.6 INSTALLING ERLANG ARTICLE

Programs in Erlang
In this activity we'll cover the basics of programs in Erlang, and you'll write your first Erlang program. We'll consider types of data in Erlang and the use of variables and patterns.

[x] 1.15 VARIABLES AND PATTERNS IN PRACTICE ARTICLE
[x] 1.16 SUMMING UP VIDEO (07:01)
[x] 1.17 PROGRAMS IN ERLANG - RECAP QUIZ

Functions in Erlang
In this activity we'll consider functions in Erlang. We'll introduce the key concept of recursion - both 'direct' and 'tail' recursion - for defining functions, and further explore the ideas of pattern matching.
